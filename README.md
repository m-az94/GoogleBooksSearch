# Google Books React App

This application has been deployed on heroku: https://enigmatic-lake-85009.herokuapp.com/

## Notes for TAs
As mentioned in the comments on Bootcamp Spot, I've had some trouble with this project. I've added screenshots for your convenience


### Issue 1: Search Results 

The image below shows the search results from an axios call to googlebooks, in the console, but not on the search page:

### Issue 2: Saved Page

The images below show that although I can't select from the search page into the saved page, I can still delete data that has been seeded into the database. Catcher in the Rye is present in the first image but was deleted in the second.

### Issue 3: Heroku

I've tried pushing to heroku after the initial push. However, the application won't update.
